Hello! From now on, this is where updates will go, whether it be progress on writing or my mental health!

15/08/2023: FILE CREATION - yeah so my mental health isn't doing the best so there's little progress in writing. IDK how much longer my current state will last, but I'm
not going to be working on it for a while. <i>Cheers!</i>

22/08/2023: heya all I'm doing a bit better but still no progress on the AU. I'll probably restart writing on the 25th, but who knows.

23/09/2023: Wow within the last month I got nothing done.

10/10/2023: Nothing so far.

16/10/2023: I've been going through some old Discord messages... and it's giving me a reason to write. I need to <b>STAY DETERMINED.</b>

19/11/2023: nope.

15/01/2024: yes, i'm still alive, but my mental health has gone to sh*t.
